# Project Title: Video Game Sales Analysis



## Project Description
You are working for "Streamchik," an online store that sells computer games worldwide. Your goal is to identify patterns that determine the success of video games. This analysis will help the company make informed decisions about potential best-selling products and plan effective marketing campaigns.

The dataset contains historical data on game sales, user and expert reviews, genres, and platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation) from open sources. You are working with data up to the year 2016, and it is now December 2016. The aim is to practice working with data, and whether you forecast sales for 2017 based on 2016 data or 2027 based on 2026 data is irrelevant.

The dataset includes the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) rating, which categorizes video game content by age appropriateness, such as "Adults Only," "Early Childhood," or "Teen."



## Project Structure

1. Data Exploration
Load the data from the file 
Inspect the first few rows.
Get general information about the dataset.
Visualize data distributions.

2. Data Preprocessing
Rename columns to lowercase.
Convert data types as necessary (explain changes and reasons).
Handle missing values (explain the approach).
Address 'tbd' values in the user score column.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the number of games released each year.
Examine how sales vary by platform, identifying platforms with the highest total sales and plotting sales trends over time.
Determine the relevant period for analysis.
Identify leading platforms in terms of sales and select potentially profitable platforms.
Create a box plot for global game sales by platform.
Investigate the relationship between user and critic reviews and global sales.

4. Genre Analysis
Explore the distribution of games by genre.
Identify the most profitable genres.

5. Regional User Profiles
Determine the top 5 platforms and genres in North America (NA), Europe (EU), and Japan (JP).
Analyze the impact of the ESRB rating on sales in each region.

6. Hypothesis Testing
Test two hypotheses with a chosen significance level (alpha):
Hypothesis 1: Are the average user ratings for Xbox One and PC games equal?
Hypothesis 2: Are the average user ratings for Action and Sports games different?



## Results
The project will provide insights into video game sales trends, including platform and genre preferences, as well as the influence of ratings on sales in different regions. It will also test specific hypotheses related to user ratings.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
SciPy
Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
In future iterations, advanced machine learning models could be implemented to predict the success of future game releases based on historical data. Additionally, considering the growth of online streaming platforms, analyzing the impact of online user reviews and streaming data on game sales could be explored.
