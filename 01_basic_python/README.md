# Project Title: Moscow vs. St. Petersburg Music Behavior Analysis

## Project Description
The comparison between Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths and stereotypes:

Moscow is often seen as a megacity, subject to the rigid rhythms of the workweek.
St. Petersburg is regarded as a city of unique culture, distinct from Moscow.
Some of these myths reflect reality, while others are empty stereotypes. Business decisions should distinguish between the two to make rational choices. Using real data from Yandex Music, we will investigate hypotheses and compare user behavior in these two capitals.

## Hypotheses
User activity varies by the day of the week, and this difference is distinct between Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Monday mornings in Moscow see a prevalence of certain music genres, while in St. Petersburg, it's different. This pattern also holds for Friday evenings.

Moscow and St. Petersburg have distinct music genre preferences, with Moscow favoring pop music and St. Petersburg leaning towards Russian rap.
