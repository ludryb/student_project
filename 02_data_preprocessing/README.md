# Project Title: Credit Behavior Analysis

## Project Description
This project is commissioned by a bank's credit department with the objective of investigating whether a client's family status and the number of children they have impact their ability to repay loans on time. The dataset provided by the bank contains statistics on the creditworthiness of its clients.

The findings of this research will play a pivotal role in the development of a credit scoring model, a specialized system that evaluates the potential borrower's capacity to repay loans to the bank.

## Project Structure
1. Data Collection
Access and acquire credit-related data.

2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Investigate patterns related to the number of children, family status, income level, and loan purpose.

4. Data Visualization
Create informative and visually appealing plots and graphs to present the findings.

5. Conclusion and Insights
Summarize key observations and provide insights into credit behavior.

## Results
The analysis will provide valuable insights into the relationship between family status, the number of children, income level, loan purpose, and the likelihood of timely credit repayment. These insights will help the bank make more informed lending decisions.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
This project can be extended to include additional factors that may affect credit behavior, such as credit history, employment status, and geographical location. Additionally, machine learning models could be developed to predict creditworthiness more accurately.
